The stochastic gradient descent algorithm randomly picks 1 training example, computes the derivative of cost for that trainining example and then updates the weights (if the update would result in reaching a smaller value for cost than current value). Since each training example is randomly chosen, hopefully, we are avoiding the problem of being stuck on the same region of the plot. <br> \n",

Say training set size, m = 100000000, then batch gradient descent will take an infinitely long time compared to SGD, because batch GD requires to go through all training examples, compute their gradient and then average over them, in order to update the parameters.)</i> <br> <br>\n",

        "2. **Mini-batch gradient descent**: In mini-batch gradient descent, we take a small subset of the training data, and update the weights after looking at all examples in the subset. Here, we *just assume that* there won't be no two points of local minima in any given subset (mini-batch), and gradient descent on each mini-batch would converge to the global minimum for that mini-batch.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stochastic gradient descent with momentum**: In SGD with momentum, the algorithm remembers what change (or what update) was done during the previous iteration. Hence, when updating the parameter $\\small \\Theta$, it applies the usual SGD update, and then adds the value of the update during the preceeding iteration, refactored (i.e. multiplied) by an exponential decay factor $\\small \\beta$.
